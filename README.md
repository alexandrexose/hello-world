# hello-world
This is my first project, just trying to make sense of GitHub. Apparently is a web hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It let you and other work together in different projects from anywhere.
In the future I would like to share this doc with my friend Juan, so we can work together in our first project.

About me:
My name is Alex and I want to become a web developer.
I've done a few courses (Administration of Computer Systems, Web development) and I might start studying Computer Science.
